### Requirements
* Python 3 distribution: Anaconda
* Other needed package name(s): pillow 

## Tutorial
(A raw image `Figure_28.png` and its fat tagged version `Figure_28_tagged.png` from the directiory **Small_samples** will be referred to demonstrate fat analysis)

1) Once this repository is downloaded in your local machine, open the Fatquant folder using an IDE that supports Python 3 (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
2) Run the file named `tool_dos.py` under an interpreter of Anaconda and execute options from the menu as per requirements.

#### Option 1
This option allows binary thresholding to be performed on either a raw image or a tagged image in each attempt.
